<h1>Explantion of the sistem</h1>
This consists of a system that takes the scores of the student and checks if they have passed or not on the semester. It takes the G1 score and G2 score and calculates the grade point average (GPA) using the formula: GF = (G1 + G22)/3.
If the student does not achieve a 6.0 on this calculation, they are given another chance by taking the AF test, which has a calculation of FF = (GF + AF2)/3.
The system also collects the student's attendance frequency, as if they do not have 75% attendance, they will be considered failed even if they pass 6.0 on the final.
The final output displays all the data collected by the system.
